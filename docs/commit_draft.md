## Changes

### Metric System Overhaul
1. Enhanced Surface2DMetricTensor Class:
   - Added comprehensive documentation explaining metric tensor concepts
   - Improved type safety with dedicated types for parameter/world space vectors
   - Added vector space operations (raise/lower indices)
   - Implemented pullback/pushforward operations for coordinate transformations
   - Added metric consistency validation
   - Reorganized internal storage with arrays for better structure
   - Added noexcept specifications where appropriate

2. Key New Features:
   - Vector transformation between parameter and world space
   - Proper handling of tangential and normal components
   - Robust validation of metric tensor consistency
   - Improved numerical stability with epsilon checks

3. Code Quality Improvements:
   - Added detailed documentation for all methods
   - Improved error handling with specific exceptions
   - Better type safety with dedicated vector types
   - More consistent naming conventions

4. Christoffel Symbols Implementation:
   - Enhanced implementation of first and second kind Christoffel symbols
   - Added comprehensive documentation explaining geometric meaning
   - Improved numerical stability in calculations
   - Better organization of computations with clear intermediate steps
   - Added bounds checking for indices
   - Optimized calculations with const correctness

5. Coordinate System Evolution:
   - Replaced simple Point class with template-based Coord system
   - Trade-offs:
     * Gained: Type safety, space-specific operations, compile-time checks
     * Lost: Simplicity and readability of original Point implementation
     * Increased complexity may impact maintainability
   - Added specialized types for different coordinate spaces
   - Enhanced validation and error checking
   - Improved mathematical correctness through strict typing
   - Note: Some valued aspects of the original design were lost in the transition

6. Path System Improvements:
   - Replaced generic Point types with specialized GeometryPoint2
   - Enhanced path classes with comprehensive documentation
   - Improved memory management with move semantics
   - Added parameter validation and error handling
   - Optimized path segment storage
   - Made path classes final where appropriate
   - Added strong contracts through pre/post-conditions
   - Improved geodesic curve computation
   - Enhanced path evaluation with better interpolation
   - Added adaptive sampling based on curvature
   - Improved tangent/normal vector calculations
   - Added detailed diagnostic logging
   - Optimized memory usage with pre-allocated vectors
   - Added RK4 integration state for accuracy

## Impact
This major overhaul brings mixed changes to the library:

1. Robustness:
   + Stronger type safety prevents coordinate space mixing
   + Improved validation catches errors early
   + Better numerical stability
   - More complex error handling required
   - Increased potential for template-related issues

2. Functionality:
   + New coordinate transformation capabilities
   + Enhanced support for curved surfaces
   + Better handling of tangential/normal components
   - Some operations more verbose than before
   - Increased compilation complexity

3. Maintainability:
   + Comprehensive documentation aids understanding
   + Clearer separation of concerns
   + Better error messages
   - More complex template code to maintain
   - Higher learning curve for new contributors
   - Some simple operations now require more boilerplate

## Testing
The changes require thorough testing across several areas:

1. Core Functionality:
   - Metric tensor operations
   - Coordinate transformations
   - Christoffel symbols calculations

2. Edge Cases:
   - Degenerate metrics
   - Numerical stability near singularities
   - Boundary conditions
   - Template instantiation edge cases

3. Integration:
   - Path length calculations
   - Geodesic computations
   - Surface transformations
   - Cross-component interactions

New test files have been added to cover these areas:
- path_length_tests.cpp
- path_tests.cpp
- space_transformation_tests.cpp
