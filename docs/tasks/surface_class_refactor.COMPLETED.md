# [COMPLETED 2025-01-23] Surface Class Refactoring

Status: âœ… Completed
Date: January 23, 2025
Changes:
- Removed virtual functions from Surface class
- Moved FunctionSurface functionality directly into Surface
- Added WorldToParamFunction type and direct constructor
- Updated FlatPatch and SphereSurface implementations with member functions
- Converted to using std::bind for function objects
- All tests passing with preserved functionality

# Surface Class Refactoring

## Objective
Simplify the Surface class by removing virtual functions and the factory pattern, while making the code more direct and clear by using member functions bound to function objects.

## Current Issues
1. Surface uses virtual functions which add complexity
2. FunctionSurface implementation is separate from Surface
3. Factory pattern adds unnecessary indirection
4. Lambda usage makes code less clear and harder to understand

## Changes Required

### 1. Surface Class Changes
- Remove all virtual functions including destructor
- Move FunctionSurface functionality directly into Surface
- Add WorldToParamFunction type:
```cpp
using WorldToParamFunction = std::function<ParamPoint3(const WorldPoint3&)>;
```
- Make constructor public and direct

### 2. Constructor Parameters
Required function objects:
- position_func: PositionFunction
- du_func: DerivativeFunction
- dv_func: DerivativeFunction
- duu_func: DerivativeFunction
- duv_func: DerivativeFunction
- dvv_func: DerivativeFunction
- gaussian_func: CurvatureFunction
- mean_func: CurvatureFunction
- world_to_param_func: WorldToParamFunction (new)

Optional parameters:
- path_solver: std::optional<PathSolver>
- type: SurfaceType
- Metric derivatives (du2_du through dv2_dv)

### 3. Surface Implementation Changes
Current surface implementations in surfaces/ need to be updated:

#### FlatPatch
- Create implementation class with member functions
- Use std::bind to create function objects from member functions
- Keep factory function interface unchanged
- Maintain validation checks

#### SphereSurface
- Create implementation class with member functions
- Use std::bind to create function objects from member functions
- Keep factory function interface unchanged
- Maintain validation checks

### 4. Test Updates Required
Verify these tests continue to pass:
- space_transformation_tests.cpp
  * Orthogonal basis transformations
  * Normal distance calculations
  * Outside parameter range
  * Skewed basis
  * Degenerate cases
  * Path creation

### 5. File Changes Required

#### include/shap/surface.hpp
- Remove virtual functions
- Add WorldToParamFunction type
- Move FunctionSurface members to Surface
- Make constructor public
- Remove factory method

#### src/surface.cpp
- Move FunctionSurface implementation into Surface
- Remove FunctionSurface class
- Remove create() implementation
- Update Surface constructor

#### include/shap/surfaces/flat_patch.hpp
- Add implementation class with member functions
- Use std::bind to create function objects
- Keep factory function interface

#### include/shap/surfaces/sphere_surface.hpp
- Add implementation class with member functions
- Use std::bind to create function objects
- Keep factory function interface

### 6. Breaking Changes
- Removal of factory method requires updating Surface creation sites:
  * space_transformation_tests.cpp
  * path_length_tests.cpp
  * cube surface collection
- Direct constructor usage requires bundling all function objects at creation site
- All changes must maintain build compatibility

## Success Criteria
1. Build succeeds without errors
2. All space transformation tests pass without modification to test logic
   * Orthogonal basis transformations must work exactly as before
   * Normal distance calculations must maintain precision
   * Outside parameter range behavior must be preserved
   * Skewed basis handling must remain accurate
   * Degenerate case detection must be maintained
   * Path creation must work identically
3. No virtual functions in Surface
4. No separate FunctionSurface class
5. All surface types constructed directly
6. All functionality preserved through bound member functions
7. No changes to geometric calculations or transformations
8. Code is more direct and clear through use of member functions

## Implementation Order
1. Update Surface class definition
   * Remove virtual functions
   * Add WorldToParamFunction
   * Move FunctionSurface members
   * Make constructor public
2. Move FunctionSurface into Surface
   * Preserve all validation logic
   * Maintain error handling
3. Update FlatPatch
   * Create implementation class
   * Use std::bind for function objects
   * Maintain validation checks
4. Update SphereSurface
   * Create implementation class
   * Use std::bind for function objects
   * Maintain validation checks
5. Fix Surface creation sites
   * Update space_transformation_tests.cpp
   * Update path_length_tests.cpp
   * Update cube surface collection
6. Verify build and tests
   * Ensure clean build
   * Run all tests
   * Verify transformation test results match previous behavior exactly

## Notes
- Keep path creation functionality as is (non-virtual implementation already exists)
- Maintain current validation and error checking
- Preserve all geometric calculations and transformations
- Member functions make code more direct and easier to understand
- std::bind provides clean way to convert member functions to function objects
