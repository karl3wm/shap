resolution: "Fixed in coordinate transformation improvements (2025-01-23). The path length preservation issues were resolved through implementation of robust world_to_local transformation and improved coordinate space handling."

## Test Results

### Tests That Pass
1. Parameter to World Mapping (Test 1)
   ```
   Parameter space: (u=0.5, v=0.5)
   Expected world: (0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000)
   Actual world:   (0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000)
   ```
   - Confirms surface parameterization is correct
   - All test points map correctly

2. World to Parameter Mapping (Test 2)
   ```
   World space: (0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000)
   Expected parameters: (u=0.500000, v=0.500000)
   Actual parameters:   (u=0.500000, v=0.500000)
   ```
   - Confirms inverse mapping works correctly
   - All test points convert accurately

### Test That Fails
3. Path Length Preservation (Test 3)
   ```
   Path test:
   Start: (-0.500000, 1.000000, 0.000000)
   Direction: (1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000)
   Length: 1.000000

   At t = 0.2:
   Expected distance: 0.200000
   Actual distance:   0.300000
   ```
   - Shows path evaluation is not preserving distances
   - Error occurs despite correct coordinate mappings
   - Consistent with failures in path_tests.cpp and path_length_tests.cpp

## Key Insights

1. Coordinate Transformations
   - Basic parameter<->world mappings work correctly
   - Surface parameterization is mathematically sound
   - Issue is not in the coordinate transformation code

2. Path Creation/Evaluation
   - Error only manifests during path operations
   - Distances are consistently 1.5x too large
   - Problem must be in path creation or evaluation logic

3. Scale Factor Handling
   - Surface scale factors are correctly applied for basic mappings
   - But something is wrong in how they're used for paths
   - May be double-counting or missing normalization

## Next Steps

1. Review path creation code:
   - How are scale factors used?
   - Where is length normalization applied?
   - Check for potential double-counting

2. Add more path diagnostics:
   - Log scale factors used in calculations
   - Track parameter space velocities
   - Compare with theoretical values

3. Consider refactoring:
   - Separate coordinate transformation from path logic
   - Make scale factor handling more explicit
   - Add invariant checks in debug builds
