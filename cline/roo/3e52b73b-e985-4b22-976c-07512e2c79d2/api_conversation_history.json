Please retry with a tool use.\n\n# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use\n\nTool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:\n\n<tool_name>\n<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>\n<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>\n...\n</tool_name>\n\nFor example:\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\nI have completed the task...\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>\n\nAlways adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. \nIf you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. \nOtherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task. \n(This is an automated message, so do not respond to it conversationally.)"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nbuild/CMakeFiles/shap.dir/CXX.includecache\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nREADME.md\ndocs/initial_design.md\ninclude/shap/surface.hpp\ninclude/shap/geometry.hpp\ninclude/shap/path.hpp\nbuild/CMakeFiles/basic_demo.dir/depend.internal\nbuild/CMakeFiles/basic_demo.dir/depend.make\nbuild/CMakeFiles/basic_demo.dir/CXX.includecache\nbuild/CMakeFiles/shap.dir/depend.internal\nbuild/CMakeFiles/shap.dir/depend.make\nbuild/CMakeFiles/shap.dir/CXX.includecache\ninclude/shap/point.hpp\nsrc/path.cpp\ninclude/shap/surface_collection.hpp\nsrc/surface.cpp\ninclude/shap/surfaces/basic_surfaces.hpp\nexamples/basic_demo.cpp\ninclude/shap/surface_point.hpp\ninclude/shap/metric.hpp\nsrc/metric.cpp\n.gitignore\n\n# Current Time\n1/21/2025, 12:54:58 PM (UTC, UTC+0:00)\n\n# Current Mode\ncode\n</environment_details>"}],"ts":1737464099129},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<thinking>\nI need to use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.\n</thinking>\n\n<attempt_completion>\n<result>\nThe geometry.hpp file has been removed and all instances of geometry.hpp have been updated to point.hpp. The changes have been staged and a test build has been successfully completed.\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}],"ts":1737464101977},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[attempt_completion] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The user has provided feedback on the results.
