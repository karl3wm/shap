Pass epsilon/tolerance values as function or constructor parameters\n2. Use descriptive names that indicate what the tolerance controls (e.g., curvature_epsilon, length_tolerance)\n3. Document valid ranges and units for all tolerance parameters\n4. Provide reasonable defaults but allow overrides to track numerical sensitivity\n5. Use tolerances to explicitly mark areas that use numerical approximations\n\n## Class Design\n\n1. Use structs for simple data holders with public members\n2. Use classes for types that need invariant enforcement or complex behavior\n3. Mark all member functions that don't modify state as `[[nodiscard]] const`\n4. Use `noexcept` for functions that cannot throw\n5. Use `= default` for special member functions when possible\n6. Delete copy operations for non-copyable types\n7. Make destructors virtual for base classes\n\n## Memory Management\n\n1. Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) instead of raw pointers\n2. Use `std::span` for non-owning views of contiguous sequences\n3. Use references for function parameters that must be non-null\n4. Use `std::optional` for values that may not exist\n\n## Error Handling\n\n1. Use exceptions for error conditions that prevent object construction or invariant violation\n2. Use `std::optional` for operations that may fail in expected ways\n3. Document all exceptions that may be thrown\n4. Include descriptive error messages with exceptions\n5. Validate parameters as early as possible in the call chain\n6. For interfaces with normalized parameters (e.g., [0,1] ranges):\n   - Document the normalization requirements clearly\n   - Validate parameters match requirements\n   - Handle normalization internally when converting between spaces\n   - Example: Path parameter t must be in [0,1] while world_length can be any positive value\n   - Normalize parameters before passing to lower-level functions\n\n## Mathematical Invariants\n\n1. Document mathematical relationships that must be preserved:\n   - Use LaTeX-style notation in comments for complex formulas\n   - Include units and coordinate spaces (e.g., parameter space vs world space)\n   - Reference relevant mathematical papers or textbooks\n\n2. Validate invariants through testing:\n   - Create specific test cases for mathematical properties\n   - Test with different scale factors and configurations\n   - Verify relationships between spaces (e.g., parameter to world mapping)\n\n3. Handle coordinate transformations carefully:\n   - Document the metric tensor and its inverse when relevant\n   - Be explicit about which space quantities live in\n   - Avoid double-counting scale factors in transformations\n   - Maintain proper distance relationships between spaces\n\n4. Diagnostic Logging:\n   - Include detailed diagnostic output for mathematical operations\n   - Log intermediate values in calculations\n   - Show both input parameters and computed results\n   - Include expected vs actual values for key invariants\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n1. Use snake_case for functions, variables, and filenames\n2. Use PascalCase for class/struct names\n3. Use UPPER_CASE for compile-time constants\n4. Use trailing underscore for private member variables\n5. Use descriptive names that indicate purpose or behavior\n6. For mathematical quantities:\n   - Use standard mathematical notation where appropriate (e.g., du_dv for partial derivatives)\n   - Include coordinate space in variable names (e.g., param_length vs world_length)\n   - Use suffixes to distinguish between related quantities (e.g., u_start, u_end)\n\n## File Organization\n\n1. Place interface declarations in header files under `include/shap/`\n2. Place implementations in source files under `src/`\n3. Group related functionality in subdirectories\n4. Use forward declarations to minimize header dependencies\n5. Place mathematical documentation in dedicated files:\n   - Use .md files to document mathematical concepts\n   - Include diagrams or equations where helpful\n   - Reference these docs in related code files\n\n## Documentation\n\n1. Document all public interfaces with clear descriptions\n2. Include usage examples for complex interfaces\n3. Document preconditions and postconditions\n4. Use mathematical notation where appropriate for geometric concepts\n5. For mathematical operations:\n   - Document coordinate spaces and transformations\n   - Include formulas and their derivations\n   - Reference mathematical papers or resources\n   - Explain numerical approximations used\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Write unit tests for all public interfaces\n2. Include edge case and error condition tests\n3. Use descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested\n4. Structure tests in arrange/act/assert pattern\n5. For mathematical properties:\n   - Test invariants across different configurations\n   - Verify coordinate transformations\n   - Check numerical stability\n   - Include regression tests for known edge cases\n\n## Test Failure Resolution\n\n1. Diagnostic Documentation:\n   - Create a dedicated markdown file documenting the failure\n   - Include exact test output showing expected vs actual values\n   - Document any relevant mathematical relationships\n   - Reference related code sections and design decisions\n\n2. Prove the Issue:\n   - Write additional test cases that isolate the problem\n   - Add detailed diagnostic logging to show intermediate values\n   - Create minimal examples that demonstrate the issue\n   - Document mathematical invariants being violated\n\n3. Mathematical Analysis:\n   - Write out the mathematical relationships in detail\n   - Show step-by-step calculations with intermediate values\n   - Identify where computed values deviate from expected\n   - Document any assumptions being violated\n\n4. Fix Verification:\n   - Create test cases that would fail if the fix is incorrect\n   - Verify fix works across different configurations\n   - Document why the fix preserves required invariants\n   - Add regression tests to prevent future regressions\n\n5. Update Documentation:\n   - Add comments explaining the mathematical relationships\n   - Document any non-obvious implementation details\n   - Update relevant design docs with lessons learned\n   - Add examples showing correct usage patterns\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n1. Pass large objects by const reference\n2. Use `std::move` when transferring ownership\n3. Mark hot path functions for inlining\n4. Use `constexpr` for compile-time evaluation where possible\n5. For numerical computations:\n   - Use appropriate data types for required precision\n   - Consider cache-friendly data layouts\n   - Profile and optimize critical mathematical operations\n   - Document performance characteristics of algorithms\n"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ndocs/coding_conventions.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nREADME.md\ndocs/compile_time_surfaces.md\n.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json\ndocs/initial_design.md\ndocs/parameter_space.md\ndocs/length_scaling.md\ninclude/shap/surfaces/basic_surfaces.hpp\nsrc/metric.cpp\ninclude/shap/surfaces/cube.hpp\ninclude/shap/metric.hpp\ninclude/shap/path.hpp\ninclude/shap/point.hpp\ninclude/shap/surface.hpp\ninclude/shap/surface_point.hpp\ninclude/shap/surface_collection.hpp\ninclude/shap/types.hpp\ninclude/shap/surfaces/square_face.hpp\ntests/path_tests.cpp\nexamples/basic_demo.cpp\nsrc/surface_collection.cpp\ndocs/parameter_space_validation.md\nsrc/path.cpp\ndocs/space_transformations.md\ntests/space_transformation_tests.cpp\ndocs/path_length_invariants.md\ntests/path_length_tests.cpp\nCMakeLists.txt\ndocs/metric_tensor_analysis.md\nsrc/surface.cpp\ndocs/coding_conventions.md\ninclude/shap/surfaces/sphere_surface.hpp\n\n# Current Time\n1/22/2025, 2:04:27 AM (UTC, UTC+0:00)\n\n# Current Mode\nACT MODE\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<thinking>\nNow that I have the content of coding_conventions.md, I can see it already has a good section on test failure resolution.

Pass epsilon/tolerance values as function or constructor parameters\n2. Use descriptive names that indicate what the tolerance controls (e.g., curvature_epsilon, length_tolerance)\n3. Document valid ranges and units for all tolerance parameters\n4. Provide reasonable defaults but allow overrides to track numerical sensitivity\n5. Use tolerances to explicitly mark areas that use numerical approximations\n\n## Class Design\n\n1. Use structs for simple data holders with public members\n2. Use classes for types that need invariant enforcement or complex behavior\n3. Mark all member functions that don't modify state as `[[nodiscard]] const`\n4. Use `noexcept` for functions that cannot throw\n5. Use `= default` for special member functions when possible\n6. Delete copy operations for non-copyable types\n7. Make destructors virtual for base classes\n\n## Memory Management\n\n1. Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) instead of raw pointers\n2. Use `std::span` for non-owning views of contiguous sequences\n3. Use references for function parameters that must be non-null\n4. Use `std::optional` for values that may not exist\n\n## Error Handling\n\n1. Use exceptions for error conditions that prevent object construction or invariant violation\n2. Use `std::optional` for operations that may fail in expected ways\n3. Document all exceptions that may be thrown\n4. Include descriptive error messages with exceptions\n5. Validate parameters as early as possible in the call chain\n6. For interfaces with normalized parameters (e.g., [0,1] ranges):\n   - Document the normalization requirements clearly\n   - Validate parameters match requirements\n   - Handle normalization internally when converting between spaces\n   - Example: Path parameter t must be in [0,1] while world_length can be any positive value\n   - Normalize parameters before passing to lower-level functions\n\n## Mathematical Invariants\n\n1. Document mathematical relationships that must be preserved:\n   - Use LaTeX-style notation in comments for complex formulas\n   - Include units and coordinate spaces (e.g., parameter space vs world space)\n   - Reference relevant mathematical papers or textbooks\n\n2. Validate invariants through testing:\n   - Create specific test cases for mathematical properties\n   - Test with different scale factors and configurations\n   - Verify relationships between spaces (e.g., parameter to world mapping)\n\n3. Handle coordinate transformations carefully:\n   - Document the metric tensor and its inverse when relevant\n   - Be explicit about which space quantities live in\n   - Avoid double-counting scale factors in transformations\n   - Maintain proper distance relationships between spaces\n\n4. Diagnostic Logging:\n   - Include detailed diagnostic output for mathematical operations\n   - Log intermediate values in calculations\n   - Show both input parameters and computed results\n   - Include expected vs actual values for key invariants\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\n1. Use snake_case for functions, variables, and filenames\n2. Use PascalCase for class/struct names\n3. Use UPPER_CASE for compile-time constants\n4. Use trailing underscore for private member variables\n5. Use descriptive names that indicate purpose or behavior\n6. For mathematical quantities:\n   - Use standard mathematical notation where appropriate (e.g., du_dv for partial derivatives)\n   - Include coordinate space in variable names (e.g., param_length vs world_length)\n   - Use suffixes to distinguish between related quantities (e.g., u_start, u_end)\n\n## File Organization\n\n1. Place interface declarations in header files under `include/shap/`\n2. Place implementations in source files under `src/`\n3. Group related functionality in subdirectories\n4. Use forward declarations to minimize header dependencies\n5. Place mathematical documentation in dedicated files:\n   - Use .md files to document mathematical concepts\n   - Include diagrams or equations where helpful\n   - Reference these docs in related code files\n6. Documentation organization:\n   - Keep general documentation in the root docs/ directory:\n     * Design documents (e.g., initial_design.md, compile_time_surfaces.md)\n     * Coding standards and practices (coding_conventions.md)\n   - Place test failure investigations in docs/test-investigation/:\n     * Each document must include metadata (status, test name, dates, etc.)\n     * Follow the structure defined in test-investigation/README.md\n     * Update status and findings as investigation progresses\n   - Use clear, descriptive filenames that indicate document purpose\n   - Reference related documentation files in code comments\n\n## Documentation\n\n1. Document all public interfaces with clear descriptions\n2. Include usage examples for complex interfaces\n3. Document preconditions and postconditions\n4. Use mathematical notation where appropriate for geometric concepts\n5. For mathematical operations:\n   - Document coordinate spaces and transformations\n   - Include formulas and their derivations\n   - Reference mathematical papers or resources\n   - Explain numerical approximations used\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Write unit tests for all public interfaces\n2. Include edge case and error condition tests\n3. Use descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested\n4. Structure tests in arrange/act/assert pattern\n5. For mathematical properties:\n   - Test invariants across different configurations\n   - Verify coordinate transformations\n   - Check numerical stability\n   - Include regression tests for known edge cases\n\n## Test Failure Resolution\n\n1. Diagnostic Documentation:\n   - Create a dedicated markdown file in docs/test-investigation/\n   - Include required metadata header (status, test name, dates)\n   - Document exact test output showing expected vs actual values\n   - Reference related code sections and design decisions\n   - Keep status and findings up to date as investigation progresses\n\n2. Prove the Issue:\n   - Write additional test cases that isolate the problem\n   - Add detailed diagnostic logging to show intermediate values\n   - Create minimal examples that demonstrate the issue\n   - Document mathematical invariants being violated\n   - Record all attempted solutions and their outcomes\n\n3.

Update Documentation:\n   - Add comments explaining the mathematical relationships\n   - Document any non-obvious implementation details\n   - Update relevant design docs with lessons learned\n   - Add examples showing correct usage patterns\n   - Mark test failure document as RESOLVED with explanation\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n1. Pass large objects by const reference\n2. Use `std::move` when transferring ownership\n3. Mark hot path functions for inlining\n4. Use `constexpr` for compile-time evaluation where possible\n5. For numerical computations:\n   - Use appropriate data types for required precision\n   - Consider cache-friendly data layouts\n   - Profile and optimize critical mathematical operations\n   - Document performance characteristics of algorithms\n\n</final_file_content>\n\nIMPORTANT: For any future changes to this file, use the final_file_content shown above as your reference.

For a path of requested length L=1.0:\n```\nt = 0.2 should give distance = 0.2\nbut gives distance = 0.3\n```\n\nThis indicates our parameter space transformation is not maintaining the correct relationship between path parameter t and world space distance.\n\n## Mathematical Relationships\n\n### 1. Surface Parameterization (P)\n- Maps [0,1]×[0,1] → ℝ³\n- For SquareFace: P(u,v) = origin + u*du + v*dv\n- Where |du| = 2, |dv| = 2 in our test case\n\n### 2. Path Parameter (t)\n- Maps [0,1] → World Space Distance\n- Must maintain: |P(t) - P(0)| = t*L\n- Where L is requested path length\n\n### 3. Parameter Space Velocity\nFor a path moving in the u direction:\n```\ndu/dt = 1/(2|du|)  // Factor of 2 because du has length 2\n```\n\nThis means:\n- To move 1 unit in world space\n- We need to move 0.5 units in parameter space\n- Because du has length 2\n\n## Current Implementation Issue\n\nWe're currently computing:\n```cpp\nparam_length = length / du_scale;  // Scale by du since moving in x direction\nend_params = start_params + du_param * param_length;\n```\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that:\n1. Parameter derivatives (du_param, dv_param) are already scaled by the metric\n2. The parameter space needs to maintain constant world space velocity\n\n## Required Invariants\n\n1. Parameter Space Distance\n```\nΔu = L/(2|du|)  // For motion in u direction\n```\n\n2. World Space Distance\n```\n|P(t) - P(0)| = t*L\n```\n\n3. Constant Speed\n```\nd/dt|P(t) - P(0)| = L\n```\n\n## Solution Requirements\n\n1. Parameter Derivatives\n- Must account for surface metric\n- Must preserve requested length\n- Must maintain constant speed\n\n2. Path Evaluation\n- Must verify distance at each t\n- Must reach exactly requested length\n- Must maintain constant speed\n\n3.

World space lengths must be converted to parameter space\n2. For a surface vector of length L:\n   - Moving 1 unit in world space\n   - Requires parameter change of 1/L\n3. Must account for surface scale in both:\n   - Initial direction computation\n   - Path length computation\n\nThis explains why our current implementation overshoots - it's not properly accounting for the surface scale factors when converting between world space and parameter space lengths."},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ndocs/coding_conventions.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nREADME.md\ndocs/compile_time_surfaces.md\n.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json\ndocs/initial_design.md\ndocs/parameter_space.md\ndocs/length_scaling.md\ninclude/shap/surfaces/basic_surfaces.hpp\nsrc/metric.cpp\ninclude/shap/surfaces/cube.hpp\ninclude/shap/metric.hpp\ninclude/shap/path.hpp\ninclude/shap/point.hpp\ninclude/shap/surface.hpp\ninclude/shap/surface_point.hpp\ninclude/shap/surface_collection.hpp\ninclude/shap/types.hpp\ninclude/shap/surfaces/square_face.hpp\ntests/path_tests.cpp\nexamples/basic_demo.cpp\nsrc/surface_collection.cpp\ndocs/parameter_space_validation.md\nsrc/path.cpp\ndocs/space_transformations.md\ntests/space_transformation_tests.cpp\ndocs/path_length_invariants.md\ntests/path_length_tests.cpp\nCMakeLists.txt\ndocs/metric_tensor_analysis.md\nsrc/surface.cpp\ndocs/test-investigation/README.md\ndocs/coding_conventions.md\ninclude/shap/surfaces/sphere_surface.hpp\n\n# Current Time\n1/22/2025, 2:10:30 AM (UTC, UTC+0:00)\n\n# Current Mode\nACT MODE\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<thinking>\nI see that these documents need to be updated to follow our new documentation guidelines.

For a path of requested length L=1.0:\n```\nt = 0.2 should give distance = 0.2\nbut gives distance = 0.3\n```\n\nThis indicates our parameter space transformation is not maintaining the correct relationship between path parameter t and world space distance.\n\n## Mathematical Relationships\n\n### 1. Surface Parameterization (P)\n- Maps [0,1]×[0,1] → ℝ³\n- For SquareFace: P(u,v) = origin + u*du + v*dv\n- Where |du| = 2, |dv| = 2 in our test case\n\n### 2. Path Parameter (t)\n- Maps [0,1] → World Space Distance\n- Must maintain: |P(t) - P(0)| = t*L\n- Where L is requested path length\n\n### 3. Parameter Space Velocity\nFor a path moving in the u direction:\n```\ndu/dt = 1/(2|du|)  // Factor of 2 because du has length 2\n```\n\nThis means:\n- To move 1 unit in world space\n- We need to move 0.5 units in parameter space\n- Because du has length 2\n\n## Current Implementation Issue\n\nWe're currently computing:\n```cpp\nparam_length = length / du_scale;  // Scale by du since moving in x direction\nend_params = start_params + du_param * param_length;\n```\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that:\n1. Parameter derivatives (du_param, dv_param) are already scaled by the metric\n2. The parameter space needs to maintain constant world space velocity\n\n## Required Invariants\n\n1. Parameter Space Distance\n```\nΔu = L/(2|du|)  // For motion in u direction\n```\n\n2. World Space Distance\n```\n|P(t) - P(0)| = t*L\n```\n\n3. Constant Speed\n```\nd/dt|P(t) - P(0)| = L\n```\n\n## Solution Requirements\n\n1. Parameter Derivatives\n- Must account for surface metric\n- Must preserve requested length\n- Must maintain constant speed\n\n2. Path Evaluation\n- Must verify distance at each t\n- Must reach exactly requested length\n- Must maintain constant speed\n\n3. Testing\n- Must verify these invariants for:\n  * Different scale factors\n  * Different directions\n  * Different path lengths\n\n</final_file_content>\n\nIMPORTANT: For any future changes to this file, use the final_file_content shown above as your reference.

Scale Factor Handling\n   - Surface scale factors are correctly applied for basic mappings\n   - But something is wrong in how they're used for paths\n   - May be double-counting or missing normalization\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review path creation code:\n   - How are scale factors used?\n   - Where is length normalization applied?\n   - Check for potential double-counting\n\n2. Add more path diagnostics:\n   - Log scale factors used in calculations\n   - Track parameter space velocities\n   - Compare with theoretical values\n\n3. Consider refactoring:\n   - Separate coordinate transformation from path logic\n   - Make scale factor handling more explicit\n   - Add invariant checks in debug builds\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</diff>\n</replace_in_file>"}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"[replace_in_file for 'docs/test-investigation/space_transformations.md'] Result:"},{"type":"text","text":"The content was successfully saved to docs/test-investigation/space_transformations.md.\n\nHere is the full, updated content of the file that was saved:\n\n<final_file_content path=\"docs/test-investigation/space_transformations.md\">\n# Space Transformations\n\n---\nstatus: OPEN\ntest_file: tests/space_transformation_tests.cpp\ntest_name: \"test_space_transformations() - Test 3: Path Length Preservation\"\nfirst_seen: 2025-01-22\nlast_updated: 2025-01-22\nresolution: null\nrelated_issues:\n  - length_scaling.md\n  - path_length_invariants.md\n  - metric_tensor_analysis.md\n---\n\n## Test Results\n\n### Tests That Pass\n1. Parameter to World Mapping (Test 1)\n   ```\n   Parameter space: (u=0.5, v=0.5)\n   Expected world: (0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000)\n   Actual world:   (0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000)\n   ```\n   - Confirms surface parameterization is correct\n   - All test points map correctly\n\n2. World to Parameter Mapping (Test 2)\n   ```\n   World space: (0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000)\n   Expected parameters: (u=0.500000, v=0.500000)\n   Actual parameters:   (u=0.500000, v=0.500000)\n   ```\n   - Confirms inverse mapping works correctly\n   - All test points convert accurately\n\n### Test That Fails\n3. Path Length Preservation (Test 3)\n   ```\n   Path test:\n   Start: (-0.500000, 1.000000, 0.000000)\n   Direction: (1.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000)\n   Length: 1.000000\n\n   At t = 0.2:\n   Expected distance: 0.200000\n   Actual distance:   0.300000\n   ```\n   - Shows path evaluation is not preserving distances\n   - Error occurs despite correct coordinate mappings\n   - Consistent with failures in path_tests.cpp and path_length_tests.cpp\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1.
