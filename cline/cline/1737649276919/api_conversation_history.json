Move function pointers into Surface as primary resources\n2. Create a consolidated RiemannianMetric class\n3. Maintain mathematical documentation in code comments\n4. Preserve existing geometric operations\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Create include/shap/riemannian_metric.hpp:\n   - Define RiemannianMetric class with constant components\n   - Move relevant mathematical comments from metric.hpp\n   - Include constructors for direct component specification and from Surface\n\n2. Update include/shap/surface.hpp:\n   - Add metric derivative function pointers\n   - Document derivative calculations in constructor comments\n   - Provide accessor methods for derivatives\n\n3. Update existing surfaces:\n   - Implement analytical derivatives for each surface type\n   - Remove numerical approximations\n   - Update constructors to provide derivative functions\n\n4. Clean up metric.hpp/cpp:\n   - Remove varying metric functionality\n   - Move Christoffel symbol calculations to RiemannianMetric\n   - Update documentation to reference new structure\n\n## Code Structure\n\n```cpp\n// In riemannian_metric.hpp\nclass RiemannianMetric {\n    // Components\n    double g11, g12, g22;\n    double dg11_du, dg11_dv;\n    double dg12_du, dg12_dv;\n    double dg22_du, dg22_dv;\n\n    // Constructors\n    RiemannianMetric(/* direct components */);\n    explicit RiemannianMetric(const Surface& surface);\n\n    // Core operations\n    determinant();\n    raise_indices();\n    lower_indices();\n    christoffel_first();\n    christoffel_second();\n    // etc.\n};\n\n// In surface.hpp\nclass Surface {\n    // Function pointers\n    DerivativeFunction du_fn_, dv_fn_;\n    MetricDerivativeFunction dg11_du_fn_, dg11_dv_fn_;\n    MetricDerivativeFunction dg12_du_fn_, dg12_dv_fn_;\n    MetricDerivativeFunction dg22_du_fn_, dg22_dv_fn_;\n\n    // Constructor and accessors\n    Surface(/* function pointers */);\n    du_at();\n    dv_at();\n    dg11_du();\n    // etc.\n};\n```\n\n## Testing\n- Update existing tests to use new RiemannianMetric class\n- Verify analytical derivatives match previous numerical results\n- Ensure geodesic calculations remain accurate\n- Test metric construction from different surface types\n\n## Future Considerations\n- Optimization opportunities by caching computed values\n- Extension to other Riemannian geometry concepts\n- Support for more complex surface types\n\n## File Organization\nFollowing the one-class-one-file norm:\n1. include/shap/riemannian_metric.hpp - RiemannianMetric class\n2. src/riemannian_metric.cpp - RiemannianMetric implementation\n3. include/shap/surface.hpp - Updated Surface class\n4. src/surface.cpp - Surface implementation\n"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\ninclude/shap/surfaces/flat_patch.hpp\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nsrc/metric.cpp\ninclude/shap/metric.hpp\ndocs/tasks/riemannian_metric_refactor.md\ninclude/shap/surface.hpp\nsrc/surface.cpp\nsrc/riemannian_metric.cpp\ninclude/shap/riemannian_metric.hpp\ninclude/shap/surfaces/flat_patch.hpp\n\n# Current Time\n1/23/2025, 4:21:30 PM (UTC, UTC+0:00)\n\n# Current Mode\nACT MODE\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<thinking>\nNow I have the full context of the changes.
