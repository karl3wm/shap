Move function pointers into Surface as primary resources\\n2. Create a consolidated RiemannianMetric class\\n3. Maintain mathematical documentation in code comments\\n4. Preserve existing geometric operations\\n\\n## Implementation Steps\\n\\n1. Create include/shap/riemannian_metric.hpp:\\n   - Define RiemannianMetric class with constant components\\n   - Move relevant mathematical comments from metric.hpp\\n   - Include constructors for direct component specification and from Surface\\n\\n2. Update include/shap/surface.hpp:\\n   - Add metric derivative function pointers\\n   - Document derivative calculations in constructor comments\\n   - Provide accessor methods for derivatives\\n\\n3. Update existing surfaces:\\n   - Implement analytical derivatives for each surface type\\n   - Remove numerical approximations\\n   - Update constructors to provide derivative functions\\n\\n4. Clean up metric.hpp/cpp:\\n   - Remove varying metric functionality\\n   - Move Christoffel symbol calculations to RiemannianMetric\\n   - Update documentation to reference new structure\\n\\n## Code Structure\\n\\n```cpp\\n// In riemannian_metric.hpp\\nclass RiemannianMetric {\\n    // Components\\n    double g11, g12, g22;\\n    double dg11_du, dg11_dv;\\n    double dg12_du, dg12_dv;\\n    double dg22_du, dg22_dv;\\n\\n    // Constructors\\n    RiemannianMetric(/* direct components */);\\n    explicit RiemannianMetric(const Surface& surface);\\n\\n    // Core operations\\n    determinant();\\n    raise_indices();\\n    lower_indices();\\n    christoffel_first();\\n    christoffel_second();\\n    // etc.\\n};\\n\\n// In surface.hpp\\nclass Surface {\\n    // Function pointers\\n    DerivativeFunction du_fn_, dv_fn_;\\n    MetricDerivativeFunction dg11_du_fn_, dg11_dv_fn_;\\n    MetricDerivativeFunction dg12_du_fn_, dg12_dv_fn_;\\n    MetricDerivativeFunction dg22_du_fn_, dg22_dv_fn_;\\n\\n    // Constructor and accessors\\n    Surface(/* function pointers */);\\n    du_at();\\n    dv_at();\\n    dg11_du();\\n    // etc.\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## Testing\\n- Update existing tests to use new RiemannianMetric class\\n- Verify analytical derivatives match previous numerical results\\n- Ensure geodesic calculations remain accurate\\n- Test metric construction from different surface types\\n\\n## Future Considerations\\n- Optimization opportunities by caching computed values\\n- Extension to other Riemannian geometry concepts\\n- Support for more complex surface types\\n\\n## File Organization\\nFollowing the one-class-one-file norm:\\n1. include/shap/riemannian_metric.hpp - RiemannianMetric class\\n2. src/riemannian_metric.cpp - RiemannianMetric implementation\\n3. include/shap/surface.hpp - Updated Surface class\\n4. src/surface.cpp - Surface implementation\\n\\n\\n<environment_details>\\n# VSCode Visible Files\\ninclude/shap/surfaces/flat_patch.hpp\\n\\n# VSCode Open Tabs\\nsrc/metric.cpp\\ninclude/shap/metric.hpp\\ndocs/tasks/riemannian_metric_refactor.md\\ninclude/shap/surface.hpp\\nsrc/surface.cpp\\nsrc/riemannian_metric.cpp\\ninclude/shap/riemannian_metric.hpp\\ninclude/shap/surfaces/flat_patch.hpp\\n\\n# Current Time\\n1/23/2025, 4:21:30 PM (UTC, UTC+0:00)\\n\\n# Current Mode\\nACT MODE\\n</environment_details>\",\"tokensIn\":2,\"tokensOut\":165,\"cacheWrites\":1142,\"cacheReads\":14970,\"cost\":0.0112545}","conversationHistoryIndex":3},{"ts":1737649329190,"type":"say","say":"text","text":"Now I have the full context of the changes.
